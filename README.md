#Chosen Playa

* Author: [Mark Croxton](http://hallmark-design.co.uk/)
* Code inspired by and borrowed from Chosen Selects by [John D Wells](https://github.com/johndwells/Chosen-Selects)

## Version 1.0.0

* Requires: ExpressionEngine 2, Playa 4

## Description

Chosen is a Javascript library for making long, unwieldy select boxes more friendly. It transforms both single select dropdowns and multiselect boxes. More information and demos at http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/.

Chosen Playa is a fieldtype that can be used in place of the Playa droppanes interface. You can add related entries and access them in exactly the same way as relationships created through Playa.

Chosen Playa is considerably 'lighter' than droppanes and can help you speed up page load times.

## Current shortcomings include:

* UI breaks if field is initially hidden in tab or collapsed
* No Matrix support
* Template tags have not been extensively tested
* Entries cannot be ordered
